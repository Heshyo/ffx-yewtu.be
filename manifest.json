  "description": "This extension provides a simple and convenient way to automatically redirect YouTube video URLs to yewtu.be without the need for user interaction. The permissions needed are necessary to allow the extension to access and modify web requests made by the browser.\nTo function properly, this extension requires the following permissions:\n- activeTab: This permission allows the extension to access the currently active tab in the browser.\n- <all_urls>: This permission allows the extension to access all URLs, which is necessary to intercept and redirect requests made to YouTube video URLs.\n- webRequest and webRequestBlocking: These permissions allow the extension to use the webRequest API to intercept and block requests made by the browser. The webRequestBlocking permission is needed to block the original request and redirect it to yewtu.be.",
